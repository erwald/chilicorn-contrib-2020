This repository contains some different material related to my Chilicorn Records contribution for the year 2020. Specifically, it contains:

* Final (unmastered) audio (.wav, .mp3)
* Sheet music (.pdf)
* MIDI file (.mid, "humanised" by a [neural network](https://github.com/erwald/rachel))

The sounds are produced by the excellent free VST [Dexed](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/), based on the PERKY 06 preset. This is doubled an octave below for all voices. I use three (!) different reverbs on the return tracks: a plate reverb ([OldSkoolVerb](https://www.voxengo.com/product/oldskoolverb/)), a long, atmospheric reverb (the built-in Live Reverb effect) and another plate ([Convology XT](https://impulserecord.com/convology-xt/)). Three is definitely overkill. There is also one track with a field recording that I made on my balcony. I cut it, balanced the left and right channels, cut out low frequencies and boosted mid-high frequencies, made 270 Hz and below mono and compressed the whole thing pretty heavily.
