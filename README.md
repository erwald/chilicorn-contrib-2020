This repository contains some different material related to my Chilicorn Records contribution for the year 2020. Specifically, it contains:

* Final (unmastered) audio (.wav, .mp3)
* Sheet music (.pdf)
* MIDI file (.mid, "humanised" by a [neural network](https://github.com/erwald/rachel))

This piece is a study [fugue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugue) for 3 voices in the key of E-flat in the Phrygian dominant scale (or, as it's called in my own taxonomy, the Emerald mode of the Lapidary scale). The subject begins with the theme of the [Finlandia hymn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finlandia_hymn), a section of the symphonic poem _Finlandia_ by Jean Sibelius. The second half of the subject is my own invention. In all, there are 12 subject entries, marked in the score as "S1", "S2" and so on and arranged more or less symmetrically. Interspersed between them are 6 episodes. The piece ends with a modal iv-I64-vÂº-I cadenec.

The sounds are produced by the excellent free VST [Dexed](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed/), with a patch based on the PERKY 06 preset (well, nearly unchanged, really). This is doubled an octave below for all voices. I use three (!) different reverbs on the return tracks: a plate reverb ([OldSkoolVerb](https://www.voxengo.com/product/oldskoolverb/)), a long, atmospheric reverb (the built-in Live Reverb effect) and another plate ([Convology XT](https://impulserecord.com/convology-xt/)). Two would have been enough. There is also one track with a field recording that I made on my balcony. I cut it, balanced the left and right channels, cut out low frequencies and boosted mid-high frequencies, made 270 Hz and below mono and compressed the whole thing pretty heavily.

Feel free to use for anything at all.
